The healing orbs restore 10 health when touched and disappear after 20 seconds. The player also gains an increase to their damage and movement speed equal to the percentage of their missing health multiplied by 0.2. For example, if the player's max health was 400 and their current health was 200, they would gain 10% damage and movement speed; if it was 100, they would gain 15%, etc.</h1>
