The chance, duration, and area of effect of the debuff are based on the amount of damage taken.

Furthermore, the player wielding it has a 1/6 (16.67%) chance of dodging an attack, which inflicts the Cerebral Mindtrick debuff on them for four seconds. Despite being a debuff, it increases critical strike chance and summon damage by 10%.[1] While the debuff is active, the player cannot dodge another attack. <a className='underline font-bold'>The Brain of Confusion is always dropped from the Brain of Cthulhus Treasure Bag in Expert Mode.</a></h1>
